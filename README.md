# Ear-Worm

Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.


# User-Story 
* As a user, I can type songs into a search box and after submitting the search I will receive back a list of songs with the title I typed. 

* As a user I can then click on one of the songs and it will provide a link to view the song with the Youtube API. 

* As a user, I can then click the youtube link and listen to the song within the browser. 


# REQUIREMENTS 

-Must have at least two server-side APIs
-Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
